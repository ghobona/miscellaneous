  title: "A sample API conforming to the standard OGC API - Features - Part 1: Core"
  version: "1.0.0"
  description: |-
    This is a sample OpenAPI definition that conforms to the conformance 
    classes "Core", "GeoJSON", "HTML" and "OpenAPI 3.0" of the
    standard "OGC API - Features - Part 1: Core".
    
    This example is a generic OGC API Features definition that uses path 
    parameters to describe all feature collections and all features. 
    The generic OpenAPI definition does not provide any details on the 
    collections or the feature content. This information is only available 
    from accessing the feature collection resources.
    
    There is 
    [another example](https://app.swaggerhub.com/apis/cportele/ogcapi-features-1-example2/1.0.0) 
    that specifies each collection explicitly.
